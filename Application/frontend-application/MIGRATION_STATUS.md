## Next Steps (Phase 4: Additional Features)

Based on the original route mapping, the following pages could be implemented:

- [ ] Equipment (`/equipment`)
- [ ] Parent Portal (`/parent-portal`)
- [ ] Skills (`/skills`)
- [ ] Guardians (`/guardians`)

### 3. AI-Enhanced Features

## Migration Approach
1. **Convert TypeScript to JavaScript**: Remove all type annotations, interfaces, and TypeScript-specific syntax
2. **Replace Wouter with Next.js Router**: Use Next.js App Router for navigation
3. **Maintain UI/UX**: Keep the same design and user experience
4. **Use Mock Data**: Implement with mock data first, prepare for Django API integration later

## Important Notes
- All routes use the authenticated layout (requires login)
- Using mock data until Django backend is ready
- Maintaining same component structure as original
- CSS is working correctly after fixing Tailwind configuration
- Following mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent UI patterns across all pages
