- **UI**: React PWA with Tailwind CSS, featuring role-based views, drag-and-drop scheduling, and real-time stats.
- **Training**: Coaches/admins onboard via tutorials in React UI.

### Sample Code Snippet (Dashboard Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function loadDashboard(userId, teamId) {
  // Fetch user role
  const { data: user } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('role')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single();

  // Fetch team data
  const { data: roster } = await supabase
    .from('team_rosters')
    .select('player_id, user_profiles(name, jersey_number)')
    .eq('team_id', teamId);

  const { data: schedule } = await supabase
    .from('events')
    .select('event_id, type, start_time, location')
    .eq('team_id', teamId);

  const { data: stats } = await supabase
    .from('game_stats')
    .select('game_id, player_id, metric_type, value')
    .eq('team_id', teamId);

  const { data: media } = await supabase
    .from('media')
    .select('media_id, url, tags')
    .eq('team_id', teamId);

  // Fetch payment status
  const paymentResponse = await axios.get('https://api.hellopayments.net/payments', {
    params: { team_id: teamId },
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer HELLOPAYMENTS_API_KEY' },
  });

  // Notify new content
  if (media.length > 0) {
    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `New media for team ${teamId} available`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  return {
    role: user.role,
    roster,
    schedule,
    stats,
    media,
    payments: paymentResponse.data,
  };
}
```

### Why This Approach Stands Out?
- **Core Excellence**: Replicates GameChanger’s free management/streaming and TeamSnap’s scheduling/communication, ensuring basics are robust.[](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamechanger/id1308415878)[](https://appgrooves.com/compare/app-gamechanger-team-manager-by-gamechanger-media-inc/app-teamsnap-sport-team-management-by-teamsnap-inc)
- **Gap Fixes**: Improves GameChanger’s messaging (email, threads) and TeamSnap’s performance (no ads, faster UI).[](https://www.reddit.com/r/GameChangerApp/comments/xts2uy/could_gc_free_replace_teamsnap/)[](https://appgrooves.com/compare/app-gamechanger-team-manager-by-gamechanger-media-inc/app-teamsnap-sport-team-management-by-teamsnap-inc)
- **AI-Ready**: Supabase and Grok 3 lay groundwork for future AI enhancements, unlike competitors.
- **Youth-Focused**: Tailored for young athletes with multilingual support via Translation Hub.
- **Offline Access**: Supabase edge functions ensure field usability.
- **Cost-Effective**: HelloPayments.net offers flexible pricing, addressing TeamSnap’s high costs.[](https://www.discussfastpitch.com/threads/team-management-apps-what-do-you-like.34660/)

**Action**: Build MVP with team management, scheduling, communication, scorekeeping, and photo sharing. Test with 2–3 teams (e.g., soccer, baseball). Expand in phase 2 (6 months).
