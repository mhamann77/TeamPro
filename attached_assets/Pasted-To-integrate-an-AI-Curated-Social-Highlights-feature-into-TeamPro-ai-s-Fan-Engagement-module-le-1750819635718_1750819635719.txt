### Sample Code Snippet (Social Highlights Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function curateSocialHighlights(playerId, eventId) {
  // Fetch clips and metrics
  const { data: clips } = await supabase
    .from('player_clips')
    .select('video_id, video_url, metric_tags')
    .eq('player_id', playerId)
    .eq('event_id', eventId);

  const { data: metrics } = await supabase
    .from('performance_metrics')
    .select('metric_type, value')
    .eq('player_id', playerId)
    .eq('event_id', eventId);

  // Curate highlights
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    player_id: playerId,
    event_id: eventId,
    clips: clips,
    metrics: metrics,
    task: 'curate_social_highlights',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { highlights } = response.data; // e.g., [{ video_url: 'url', platform: 'instagram', captions: 'Goal!', hashtags: '#YouthSoccer' }]

  // Format for social platforms
  const formattedHighlights = await Promise.all(highlights.map(async h => {
    const formatResponse = await axios.post('https://mediaconvert.amazonaws.com', {
      input: h.video_url,
      output: { platform: h.platform, resolution: h.platform === 'tiktok' ? '1080x1920' : '1080x1080' },
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_MEDIACONVERT_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
    return { ...h, formatted_url: formatResponse.data.output };
  }));

  // Store highlights
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('social_highlights')
    .insert(formattedHighlights.map(h => ({
      player_id: playerId,
      event_id: eventId,
      video_id: h.video_id,
      video_url: h.formatted_url,
      platform: h.platform,
      captions: h.captions,
      hashtags: h.hashtags,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    })));

  // Notify
  if (!error) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        player_id: playerId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: `New social highlights for Player ${playerId} ready`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Social highlights for Player ${playerId} ready`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return formattedHighlights;
  throw error;
}
```
