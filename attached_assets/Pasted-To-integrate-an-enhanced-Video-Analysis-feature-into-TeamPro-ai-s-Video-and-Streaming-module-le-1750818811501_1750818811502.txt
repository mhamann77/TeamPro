### Sample Code Snippet (Video Analysis Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function analyzeVideo(userId, videoId, metrics) {
  // Analyze video for technique
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    user_id: userId,
    video_id: videoId,
    metrics: metrics, // e.g., { speed: 7.2, pass_completion: 85 }
    task: 'analyze_technique',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { flaws, drills } = response.data; // e.g., { flaws: ['low knee lift'], drills: ['leg swings'] }

  // Store analysis
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('video_analysis')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      video_id: videoId,
      flaws,
      drills,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

  // Log and notify
  if (!error) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        video_id: videoId,
        content: `Technique analysis: ${flaws.join(', ')}. Drills: ${drills.join(', ')}`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Technique analysis for user ${userId}: ${flaws.join(', ')}`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
