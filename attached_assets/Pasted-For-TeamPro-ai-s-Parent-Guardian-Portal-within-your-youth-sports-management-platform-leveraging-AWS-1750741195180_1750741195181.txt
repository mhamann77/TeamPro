### Common Gaps Across Competitors
- **AI Personalization**: No platforms use AI for tailored insights or communication, missing opportunities to engage parents.
- **Offline Access**: Lack of offline functionality frustrates users at fields with poor connectivity.

import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

function ParentSchedule() {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchEvents = async () => {
      const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from('events')
        .select('id, date, title, location')
