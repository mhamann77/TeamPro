### Sample Code Snippet (AutoStream Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function startAutoStream(eventId) {
  // Fetch event details
  const { data: event } = await supabase
    .from('events')
    .select('start_time, team_id, sport')
    .eq('id', eventId)
    .single();

  // Start stream with MediaLive
  const streamResponse = await axios.post('https://medialive.amazonaws.com', {
    channelId: 'TEAMPRO_STREAM_CHANNEL',
    startTime: event.start_time,
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_MEDIALIVE_CREDENTIALS' },
  });

  // Analyze video for highlights
  const highlightResponse = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    event_id: eventId,
    video_stream: streamResponse.data.streamUrl,
    metrics: ['speed', 'xG', 'possession'],
    task: 'generate_highlights',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { highlights } = highlightResponse.data;

  // Store highlights
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('media')
    .insert(highlights.map(h => ({
      event_id: eventId,
      team_id: event.team_id,
      video_url: h.url,
      metric_tags: h.metrics,
      captions: h.captions,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    })));

  // Notify viewers
  if (!error) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        team_id: event.team_id,
        content: `New highlights available for event ${eventId}`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Highlights for event ${eventId} ready`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return { streamUrl: streamResponse.data.streamUrl, highlights };
  throw error;
}
```

### Why This Approach Stands Out?
- **AI Automation**: AutoStream’s live streaming and highlight generation surpass TeamSnap’s manual uploads.
