    metrics: metrics, // e.g., { speed: 7.2, pass_completion: 85 }
    task: 'generate_training_plan',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { drills, protocols, videos } = response.data;

  // Store plan
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('training_plans')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      event_id: eventId,
      drills,
      protocols,
      video_ids: videos,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

  // Log plan assignment
  if (!error) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: `New training plan assigned: ${drills.join(', ')}`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Training plan for user ${userId}: ${drills.join(', ')}`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return { drills, protocols, videos };
  throw error;
}
```
