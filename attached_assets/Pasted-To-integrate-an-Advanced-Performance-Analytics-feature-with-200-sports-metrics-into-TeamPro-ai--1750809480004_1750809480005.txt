To integrate an **Advanced Performance Analytics** feature with 200+ sports metrics into TeamPro.ai’s AI-driven platform, leveraging AWS, Supabase, Grok 3 on MCP servers, HelloPayments.net, and existing features (e.g., Smart Scheduler, Calendar Sync, Predictive Availability, Communication Log, Translation Hub), I’ll outline a framework for building a comprehensive analytics suite tailored for youth sports management. This addresses competitor gaps (e.g., TeamSnap’s basic stats, SportsEngine’s limited metrics) and aligns with your intelligent strategy. The focus is on delivering actionable, sport-specific insights for coaches, players, parents, and organizers, incorporating advanced metrics inspired by professional platforms like Catapult, KINEXON, and StatsBomb. Below are the requirements, prioritized features, and implementation strategy, with insights from web sources on advanced sports analytics.

### Competitor Context and Gaps
- **TeamSnap**: Tracks basic stats (e.g., attendance, game scores) but lacks advanced metrics (e.g., player workload, biomechanical data). Limited to manual input, no AI-driven insights.
- **SportsEngine**: Offers game stats and video highlights but lacks depth (e.g., no 200+ metrics, no predictive analytics). High costs ($799+/year) and complex UI.
- **Spond**: Free platform with basic performance tracking, no advanced metrics or sport-specific customization.
- **LeagueApps**: Provides team stats but lacks real-time analytics, biomechanical insights, or integration with wearables.
- **Common Gaps**:
  - Limited to basic stats (e.g., goals, points) without advanced metrics like expected goals (xG) or player exertion.
  - No integration with wearables or video for real-time data.
  - Lack of predictive analytics for performance or injury risk.
  - Poor support for youth sports or multilingual accessibility.

### Sample Code Snippet (Metrics Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function calculateMetrics(userId, eventId, data) {
  // Process wearable and video data
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    user_id: userId,
    event_id: eventId,
    data: { wearable: data.wearable, video: data.video },
    task: 'calculate_metrics',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const metrics = response.data.metrics; // e.g., { speed: 7.2, pass_completion: 85, xG: 0.3 }

  // Store metrics
  const { data: stored, error } = await supabase
    .from('performance_metrics')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      event_id: eventId,
      metric_type: Object.keys(metrics),
      value: Object.values(metrics),
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

  // Log high-performance alerts
  if (metrics.injury_risk > 0.7) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: `High injury risk detected: ${metrics.injury_risk}`,
        intent_tag: 'urgent',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `High injury risk for user ${userId}`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return metrics;
  throw error;
}
```

### Additional Insights from Web Sources
