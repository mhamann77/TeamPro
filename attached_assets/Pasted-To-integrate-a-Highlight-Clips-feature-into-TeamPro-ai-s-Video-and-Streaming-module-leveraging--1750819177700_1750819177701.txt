### Sample Code Snippet (Highlight Clips Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function generateHighlightClips(playerId, eventId) {
  // Fetch video and metrics
  const { data: video } = await supabase
    .from('media')
    .select('video_url, metadata')
    .eq('event_id', eventId)
    .single();

  const { data: metrics } = await supabase
    .from('performance_metrics')
    .select('metric_type, value')
    .eq('player_id', playerId)
    .eq('event_id', eventId);

  // Generate clips
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    player_id: playerId,
    event_id: eventId,
    video_url: video.video_url,
    metrics: metrics,
    task: 'generate_highlight_clips',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { clips } = response.data; // e.g., [{ url: 'clip_url', metrics: { speed: 7.5 }, captions: 'Goal!' }]

  // Store clips
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('player_clips')
    .insert(clips.map(c => ({
      player_id: playerId,
      event_id: eventId,
      video_id: c.video_id,
      video_url: c.url,
      metric_tags: c.metrics,
      captions: c.captions,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    })));

  // Notify
  if (!error) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        player_id: playerId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: `New highlight clips available for Player ${playerId}`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Highlights for Player ${playerId} ready`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return clips;
  throw error;
}
```

### Why This Approach Stands Out?
