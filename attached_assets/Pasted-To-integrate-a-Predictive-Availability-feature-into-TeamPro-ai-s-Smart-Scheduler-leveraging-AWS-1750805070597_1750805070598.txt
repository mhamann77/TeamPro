To integrate a **Predictive Availability** feature into TeamPro.ai’s Smart Scheduler, leveraging AWS, Supabase, Grok 3 on MCP servers, HelloPayments.net, and existing features (e.g., Calendar Sync, Communication Log, Translation Hub), I’ll outline a framework for predicting user (players, coaches, volunteers) availability based on historical data. This will enhance conflict detection and scheduling, addressing competitor gaps (e.g., TeamSnap’s manual RSVPs, SportsEngine’s basic conflict checks) and aligning with your AI-driven strategy for youth sports management. Below are the prioritized features, configurations, and implementation details to stand out against competitors like TeamSnap, SportsEngine, Spond, and LeagueApps.

### Competitor Context and Gaps
- **TeamSnap**: Relies on manual RSVP submissions, with no predictive availability or historical analysis. 30% notification failures disrupt scheduling.
- **SportsEngine**: Tracks RSVPs but lacks predictive models or automated availability insights. Complex UI and high costs ($799+/year) limit usability.
- **Spond**: Free RSVP tools but no predictive analytics or historical data usage for scheduling.
- **LeagueApps**: Basic availability tracking, no AI-driven predictions or conflict prevention. Expensive setup fees deter small teams.
- **Common Gaps**:
  - No platforms use historical data to predict availability.
  - Limited automation for preempting scheduling conflicts.
  - Lack of sport-specific availability patterns or offline support.

### Sample Code Snippet (Predictive Availability Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function predictAvailability(userId, eventId) {
  // Fetch historical availability
  const { data: history } = await supabase
    .from('availability')
    .select('status, timestamp, event_type')
    .eq('user_id', userId);

  // Predict availability with Grok 3
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    user_id: userId,
    event_id: eventId,
    historical_data: history,
    task: 'predict_availability',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { probability, predicted_status } = response.data;

  // Store prediction
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('predictions')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      event_id: eventId,
      probability,
      predicted_status,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

  // Check for conflicts
  if (predicted_status === 'unavailable') {
    const conflictMsg = `Predicted unavailability for user ${userId} at event ${eventId}`;
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: conflictMsg,
        intent_tag: 'urgent',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: conflictMsg,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return { predicted_status, probability };
  throw error;
}
```

### Why This Approach Stands Out?
