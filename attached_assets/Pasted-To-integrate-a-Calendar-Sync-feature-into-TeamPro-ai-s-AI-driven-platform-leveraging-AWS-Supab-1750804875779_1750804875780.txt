    - `calendar_sync`: Store user calendar settings (user_id, calendar_type, sync_token, last_sync).
    - `events`: Store schedules with conflict status (event_id, date, type, team_id, conflict_status).
    - `availability`: Store user availability from signups.
    - `messages`: Log sync-related alerts (linked to Communication Log).
  - **RBAC**: Restrict parents to their child’s events, coaches to team schedules.
  - **pgvector**: Store embeddings for AI-driven conflict analysis.
  - **Edge Functions**: Cache events/sync status offline.
- **AWS**:
  - **CloudFront**: Serve React calendar UI.
  - **Lambda**: Process real-time sync and conflict detection.
  - **S3**: Store signup documents for availability data.
  - **SNS/SES**: Deliver multilingual sync alerts.
  - **KMS**: Encrypt sensitive data.
- **Grok 3 on MCP Servers**:
  - Analyze external calendar data for conflicts.
  - Optimize sync schedules and prioritize events.
  - Train on sport-specific datasets for customization.
- **Calendar APIs**:
  - Google Calendar API: OAuth 2.0 for two-way sync.
  - Microsoft Graph API: OAuth for Outlook integration.
  - iCal Protocol: Standard .ics files for other providers.
- **HelloPayments.net**: Sync payment deadlines with dual pricing logic.

### Sample Code Snippet (Calendar Sync Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function syncCalendar(userId, calendarType, eventData) {
  // Fetch user calendar settings
  const { data: syncData } = await supabase
    .from('calendar_sync')
    .select('sync_token, calendar_type')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .single();

  // Sync event to external calendar
  let apiUrl;
  if (calendarType === 'google') {
    apiUrl = 'https://www.googleapis.com/calendar/v3/calendars/primary/events';
  } else if (calendarType === 'microsoft') {
    apiUrl = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/events';
  } else if (calendarType === 'ical') {
    apiUrl = 'ICAL_PROVIDER_URL';
  }

  const response = await axios.post(apiUrl, {
    summary: eventData.title,
    start: { dateTime: eventData.date },
    end: { dateTime: new Date(eventData.date.getTime() + 3600000) },
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${syncData.sync_token}` },
  });

  // Check for conflicts
  const conflictResponse = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    event: eventData,
    calendar_data: response.data,
    task: 'detect_conflicts',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  if (conflictResponse.data.conflicts.length > 0) {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        team_id: eventData.team_id,
        content: `Conflict: ${conflictResponse.data.conflicts.join(', ')}`,
        intent_tag: 'urgent',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Conflict: ${conflictResponse.data.conflicts.join(', ')}`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });

    if (!error) return { status: 'conflict', conflicts: conflictResponse.data.conflicts };
  }

  // Update sync status
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('events')
    .update({ sync_status: 'synced', last_sync: new Date() })
    .eq('id', eventData.event_id);

  if (!error) return { status: 'synced' };
  throw error;
}
```
