### Sample Code Snippet (Benchmarking Handler)
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import axios from 'axios';

const supabase = createClient('SUPABASE_URL', 'SUPABASE_KEY');

async function calculateBenchmarks(userId, eventId, metrics) {
  // Fetch age-group and sport data
  const { data: userData } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('age, sport')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single();

  // Calculate benchmarks
  const response = await axios.post('https://api.x.ai/grok3', {
    user_id: userId,
    event_id: eventId,
    metrics: metrics, // e.g., { speed: 7.2, pass_completion: 85 }
    age_group: userData.age,
    sport: userData.sport,
    task: 'calculate_benchmarks',
  }, {
    headers: { Authorization: 'Bearer GROK3_API_KEY' },
  });

  const { benchmarks, recommendations } = response.data; // e.g., { speed: { value: 7.2, percentile: 75 }, recommendation: 'Add sprint drills' }

  // Store benchmarks
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('benchmarks')
    .insert({
      user_id: userId,
      event_id: eventId,
      metric_type: Object.keys(benchmarks),
      value: Object.values(benchmarks).map(b => b.value),
      percentile: Object.values(benchmarks).map(b => b.percentile),
      timestamp: new Date(),
    });

  // Log recommendations
  if (recommendations.length > 0) {
    await supabase
      .from('messages')
      .insert({
        user_id: userId,
        event_id: eventId,
        content: `Benchmark recommendation: ${recommendations.join(', ')}`,
        intent_tag: 'informational',
        status: 'sent',
        timestamp: new Date(),
      });

    await axios.post('https://sns.amazonaws.com', {
      Message: `Benchmark recommendation for user ${userId}: ${recommendations.join(', ')}`,
      TopicArn: 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:TeamAlerts',
    }, {
      headers: { Authorization: 'AWS_SNS_CREDENTIALS' },
    });
  }

  if (!error) return { benchmarks, recommendations };
  throw error;
}
```

### Why This Approach Stands Out?
